# Exploratory-of-bank-stock-prices

## This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of bank stock prices, tracing their journey from the financial crisis to 2024. The project leverages advanced data visualization techniques and tools to uncover trends and patterns in the stock market.

## Key Highlights:
- Pair Plots: Created using Seaborn's sns.pairplot() to analyze relationships within the returns data frame.
- Line Plots: Utilized Matplotlib's plt.plot() to visualize the Close prices of various banks over time.
- Heatmap: Constructed with Seaborn's sns.heatmap() to visualize the correlation between stocks' Close prices.
- Cluster Map: Leveraged Seaborn's sns.clustermap() to effectively cluster correlations.
- Interactive Visualizations: Employed Plotly's plotly.graph_objects for dynamic and interactive visualizations.
## Skills Gained:
- Advanced Data Visualization using Seaborn and Plotly.
- Statistical Analysis and interpretation of stock price data.
